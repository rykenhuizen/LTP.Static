# Lawrencetown Pizza Static Site

A static website for Lawrencetown Pizza, built using [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) and [BlazorStatic](https://github.com/tesar-tech/BlazorStatic). This project generates a fast, modern, and easily maintainable static site for a local business, featuring a menu, specials, photo gallery, and contact information.

## Features

- **Static Site Generation**: Uses BlazorStatic to pre-render all pages as static HTML for fast load times and easy hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages).
- **Blazor Components**: Modular UI built with reusable Blazor components for menu categories, specials, and more.
- **Responsive Design**: Utilizes Bootstrap for mobile-friendly layouts.
- **Photo Gallery Modal**: Interactive gallery for menu item photos.
- **SEO & Analytics**: Includes Google Analytics integration and SEO-friendly markup.
- **Easy Content Updates**: Menu and specials are managed via strongly-typed C# models and data files.

## Technologies Used

- [.NET 9](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) (C# 13)
- [Blazor WebAssembly](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/)
- [BlazorStatic](https://github.com/tesar-tech/BlazorStatic) for static site generation
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling and layout
- JavaScript for modal and gallery interactivity

## Techniques

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Menu, specials, and gallery are implemented as Blazor components for maintainability and reusability.
- **Static Asset Management**: Images and content are organized for efficient static deployment.
- **Data-Driven UI**: Menu and specials are rendered from C# data models, making updates straightforward.
- **Client-Side Interactivity**: JavaScript is used for modal gallery behavior without requiring a backend.
